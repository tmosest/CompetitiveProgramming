# Graphs

This section cotains information about graph algorithms and how to implement them.

- [Breath First Search BFS](BreadthFirstSearch.md) searches for the shortest path in a tree or a graph.
- DFS
- Ford-Fulkerson
- [Floyd-Warshall Algorithm](Floyd-Warshall.md) finds shortest paths in a directed weighted graph with positive and negative edge weights.
